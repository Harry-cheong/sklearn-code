# \[BBCS24\] Introduction to Scikit-learn and Scikit-NN Datasets

This repository provides all the datasets for the workshop Introduction to Scikit-learn and Scikit-NN.

We highly recommend you start from scratch with only the datasets to try to code the models. However, if you are stuck, you can access the solutions at [https://github.com/sawzedong/sklearn-workshop/](https://github.com/sawzedong/sklearn-workshop/).

Have a great workshop experience!
